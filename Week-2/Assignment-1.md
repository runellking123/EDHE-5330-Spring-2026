## Instructions

### Part 1: Data Analysis (40 points)

Using the provided dataset (student assessment scores with demographics):

1. Calculate all measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode) for the primary variable

- Discussion section interpreting what the statistics mean for educational practice
- Conclusion with recommendations
