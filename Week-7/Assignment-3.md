**Due:** March 4, 2026
**Points:** 50

---

## Overview

This assignment challenges you to apply group comparison techniques (t-tests and ANOVA) to real higher education data. You will formulate research questions, conduct analyses, and interpret results in meaningful ways.

## Assignment Components

### Part 1: Independent Samples t-Test (15 points)

Using the provided dataset or your own approved data:
- Formulate a research question comparing two independent groups
- State the null and alternative hypotheses
- Check and report on assumptions (normality, homogeneity of variance)
- Conduct the independent samples t-test
- Report the t-statistic, degrees of freedom, and p-value
- Calculate and interpret Cohen's d effect size
- Write a results paragraph in APA format

### Part 2: Paired Samples t-Test (15 points)

Using appropriate data:
- Formulate a research question involving repeated measures or matched pairs
- State the null and alternative hypotheses
- Conduct the paired samples t-test
- Report the t-statistic, degrees of freedom, and p-value
- Calculate and interpret Cohen's d effect size
- Write a results paragraph in APA format
- Discuss the practical implications of your findings

### Part 3: One-Way ANOVA (15 points)

Using appropriate data with three or more groups:
- Formulate a research question comparing three or more groups
- State the null and alternative hypotheses
- Check and report on assumptions
- Conduct the one-way ANOVA
- Report the F-statistic, degrees of freedom, and p-value
- If significant, conduct and interpret post-hoc tests
- Calculate and interpret eta-squared effect size
- Write a results paragraph in APA format

### Part 4: Summary and Recommendations (5 points)

Write a brief summary (250-350 words) that:
- Synthesizes findings across all three analyses
- Discusses limitations of your analyses
- Provides actionable recommendations based on your findings
- Connects results to broader higher education practice or policy
