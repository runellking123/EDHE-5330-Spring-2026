   - One requiring a one-way ANOVA

2. **For Each Scenario, Explain:**
   - The research question being addressed
   - The independent and dependent variables
   - Why that particular test is appropriate
   - What the null hypothesis would be
   - What a significant result would mean practically

3. **Reflection:** Briefly discuss a situation in your professional context where group comparisons would provide valuable insights.
