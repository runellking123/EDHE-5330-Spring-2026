## Prompt

Educators use probability thinking (even informally) every day when making decisions.

1. Identify 2-3 educational decisions that involve probability (e.g., placement, intervention, resource allocation)
2. How might formal probability analysis improve these decisions?
3. What are the risks of relying on intuition rather than statistical probability?
4. Connect to educational equity - how might probability be misunderstood or misapplied in ways that harm students?
