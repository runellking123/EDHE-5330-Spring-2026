## Assignment Components

### Part 1: Descriptive Statistics (15 points)

Using the provided dataset (or approved alternative), calculate and interpret:
- Measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode)
- Measures of variability (range, variance, standard deviation)
- Create appropriate visualizations (histogram, box plot)
- Write a brief narrative describing the data distribution

### Part 2: Correlation Analysis (15 points)

Select two continuous variables from your dataset:
- Create a scatterplot showing the relationship
- Calculate the correlation coefficient (r)
- Interpret the strength and direction of the relationship

- Report the test statistic and p-value
- Make a decision about the null hypothesis
- Interpret your findings in practical terms

### Part 4: Reflection (5 points)

Write a brief reflection (200-300 words) addressing:
- What challenges did you encounter during this analysis?
- How might these statistical techniques be useful in your professional role?
- What questions do you still have about statistical analysis?
