## Instructions

The misinterpretation of correlational findings is one of the most common errors in education research and policy. In this discussion, you will critically analyze examples where correlation has been mistakenly interpreted as causation.

## Initial Post Requirements (Due: February 16, 2026)

In your initial post (minimum 300 words), complete the following:

1. **Find an Example:** Locate a news article, policy document, or research summary that makes a causal claim based on correlational data in education. This could relate to:
   - Student success factors
   - Educational interventions
   - Institutional performance metrics
   - Access and equity outcomes

2. **Analyze the Claim:**
   - What causal claim is being made?
   - What evidence is presented?
   - Why is this actually a correlation, not causation?

3. **Identify Alternative Explanations:**
   - What third variables (confounds) might explain the relationship?
   - Could the direction of causality be reversed?
   - Are there any lurking variables not considered?

4. **Implications:** What are the potential consequences of misinterpreting this correlation as causation for policy or practice?
